# Design System Overview

This project introduces a light design system aligned with the reference site.

## Color Palette

- **Text** `#111111`
- **White** `#FFFFFF`

## Typography
- **Heading Font:** Montserrat, sans-serif
- **Body Font:** Tajawal, sans-serif

## Breakpoints
Based on Tailwind defaults:
- `sm` – 640px and up
- `md` – 768px and up
- `lg` – 1024px and up
- `xl` – 1280px and up

## Components
- `Button` – basic button with `primary`, `secondary` and `danger` variants.
- Additional components (Input, Card, Modal, Navbar, Footer, etc.) should follow the same token-based approach.

## Notes
- Fonts are loaded from Google Fonts; ensure network access in production builds.
- Some assets from the reference site were unavailable; placeholders should be replaced once provided.
